#  Course Management System – Mutation Testing Project  
*Software Testing (ST) – Course Project*

## 1. Repository Link

Full project code repository (GitHub/Drive):  
**https://github.com/sassy2711/SoftwareTestingProject**

---

## 2. Project Overview

This project implements a **Course Management System** in Python and applies **Mutation Testing** at both:

- **Unit level** (within functions/methods)  
- **Integration level** (across interacting modules)

The system includes functionality for:

- Managing **students**, **courses**, **enrollments**
- Computing **grades** and **GPA**
- Generating **student reports**

Extensive unit and integration tests are designed using structured testing strategies from the course.

Mutation testing is performed using a **custom AST-based mutation framework** with independent unit-level and integration-level mutation operators.

---

## 3. Test Case Strategy Used

From the course’s required testing strategies, this project uses:

### **Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP)**  
Used for designing tests around valid and invalid inputs (e.g., score ranges, GPA computation, repository insertion rules).

### **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**  
Applied to grade thresholds (90, 80, 70, 60), course capacity limits, and student year/senior status.

### **Structural Testing using PyTest Coverage Reports**  
- Achieved **91%+ total coverage**
- Achieved **100% coverage** for several modules

### **Mutation Testing (Strong Mutation)**  
Mutants are strongly killed when test assertions detect behavioral differences.

---

## 4. Mutation Testing Details

Mutation testing is implemented using custom AST transformations.

### **Unit-level Mutation Operators (≥3 required → 3 used)**

1. **ArithmeticOperatorReplacement**  
   - Mutates `+ ↔ -`, `* ↔ /`

2. **RelationalOperatorReplacement**  
   - Mutates `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`

3. **LogicalConnectorReplacement**  
   - Mutates `and ↔ or`

---

### **Integration-level Mutation Operators (≥3 required → 3 used)**

1. **ParameterSwapMutator**  
   Swaps parameters of function calls across modules (e.g., grading functions).

2. **CallDeletionMutator**  
   Deletes integration-level calls between modules (e.g., removes score-recording logic).

3. **ReturnValueModificationMutator**  
   Breaks integration boundaries by altering returned values.

---

### Mutation Execution Summary

Surviving mutants include:

- **Equivalent mutant**  
  - `INT:ParameterSwapMutator` on `compute_grade_with_bonus` (commutative behavior: `score + bonus`)
  
- **Boundary-sensitive mutants**  
  - 2 mutants in `grading.py`
  - 2 mutants in `models.py`

After adding BVA tests, the mutation score improved from ~60% to **78.26%**.

## 5. Designed Test Cases

All test cases are located in the `tests/` directory:

tests/<br>
│── unit/<br>
│ ├── test_models.py<br>
│ ├── test_grading.py<br>
│ ├── test_enrollment.py<br>
│ ├── test_reporting.py<br>
│ └── test_repository.py<br>
└── integration/<br>
└── test_end_to_end.py<br>



Tests cover:

- Models (Student, Course, Enrollment)
- Grade computation & GPA logic
- Enrollment rules & business constraints
- Repository error handling & operations
- Report generation logic
- Full end-to-end workflows

A total of **47 test cases** are implemented.

### Coverage Summary

The project achieves an overall coverage of **98.09%**:

- 100% coverage in **enrollment**, **models**, **repository**, **utils**
- 96.67% coverage in **grading**
- 92.59% coverage in **reporting**

This satisfies the structural testing requirement of the project and demonstrates thorough test design.
